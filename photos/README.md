# Photos folder

Put your images here so the site can use them.

## Folders

- **`college.jpg`** (in this folder) — Photo of you two from college (shown in "v1.0 — Initial Commit").
- **`pune/`** — Gallery of the last 4 months in Pune. Name files `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, `3.jpg`, etc. (or edit the list in `js/main.js` / `js/config.js`).
- **`stickers/`** — Images of the stickers/drawings she gave you. You can add more sticker elements in `index.html` and point them to these images.

## Tips

- Use `.jpg` or `.png`. Keep filenames simple (no spaces).
- For the gallery, the site looks for `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, … in `pune/`. To use different names, add a `galleryImages` array in `js/config.js` and update `js/main.js` to read it.
